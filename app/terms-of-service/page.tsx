        <p className="mb-6">
          Datalinc provides website creation services for businesses and personal profiles using Next.js, which is a javascript framework. The website will be hosted on servers under control of Datalinc Pty Ltd. Our services include content creation subject to certain limitations, such as content length, number of images/videos, and file size. The Client is required to provide all images, videos, and text content for use on the website, unless otherwise specified. Other services provided by Datalinc include:
        </p>
        
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Website hosting</li>
          <li>Website maintenance</li>
          <li>Digital marketing services</li>
          <li>SEO services</li>
          <li>Social media management</li>
          <li>Copywriting and content creation</li>
          <li>Software development</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p className="mb-6">
          Each service is subject to its own terms and conditions, which will be individually created for the Client specifically for the service to provide and requirements from the Client via a contract, which will be signed by the Client and Datalinc Pty Ltd before the service is provided.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2.1 Non-Refundable Deposit and Payment Schedule</h3>
        
        <p className="mb-6">
          To begin work on the Client&apos;s website, the Client must pay a non-refundable 50% deposit. The remaining 50% payment is due upon completion of the website. The website is considered complete when it is deployed for the Client&apos;s use (&quot;Initial Deployment&quot;).
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-6">
          If the Client is dissatisfied with the final product, the Client has 7 days from the date of initial deployment to request a refund. Only the remaining 50% payment will be refunded. The initial 50% deposit is non-refundable under any circumstances.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2.2 Hosting Services and Subscription Payments</h3>
        
        <p className="mb-6">
          Clients will receive 3 months of free hosting, starting from the date of initial deployment. Hosting services will automatically transition into a subscription service at the end of the 3-month period.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-6">
          Subscription payments are billed on either the 1st or 15th of the month, depending on which date is closest to the initial deployment date. Subscription fees will continue to be charged until the Client cancels the subscription by emailing <a href="mailto:accounts@datalinc.io" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">accounts@datalinc.io</a>. No other cancellation methods will be accepted at this time, as it is a manual process. If the payment fails, the client will be notified, and the subscription will be cancelled, along with the website hosting if not resolved within 14 days. If the payment is resolved, the subscription will be reinstated.
        </p>
